Two Checkout blesta payment gateway. Implement inline checkout without redirection

Inline Checkout

Inline Checkout is our iframe checkout option which displays a secure payment form as an overlay on your checkout page. It is designed to function when the buyerâ€™s billing/shipping address has been collected and the cart total has been finalized. This makes it ideal for use with shopping cart applications or your own custom checkout process.

Note: This feature is available to all 2Checkout merchants by default - there are no additional fees to use Inline Checkout.
